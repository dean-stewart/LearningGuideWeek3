library(readr)
gapminder_csv <- read_csv("../1_data/gapminder.csv")
#read in the data equivalent to data above in 1

gapminder_wide_csv <- read_csv("../1_data/gapminder_wide.csv")
#read in wide data which we need to tidy (explored later)

gapminder_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/gapminder/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv"
#put url where the data is as an object eg. gapminder_url

gapminder_tsv <- read_tsv(gapminder_url)
#read in the data which are in tsv format

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
